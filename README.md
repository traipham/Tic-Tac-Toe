# Project Description:
This is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game created with Python and Python GUI module, Tkinter. I wanted to incorporate a page routing aspect to this project, so in addition to this project there is the tkinter page router api that I'd also worked on. 

## Functionality:
- Play
  - This is a two player game. There isn't an AI/Comp to play with so you would need to place down both X and O flags if you're playing single player. 
- Restart: 
  - Restarts the game
- End
  - Closes the game

## Project status: 
**COMPLETE**
